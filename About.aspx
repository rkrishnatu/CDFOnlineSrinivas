    <h2>Course Discussion Forum Online Application</h2>

response time that an online course discussion forum can provide.

        <br />
The users are educated, computer literate, and in most cases own personal computers in their
homes/hostels. The ability to add discussion topic for courses, questions under topic via personal
computers and to review answers provided by other students, professors, like/ vote, provide feedback to
instructor and so on on-line would greatly streamline course discussion forum application.

    <p></p><p></p>
    The Course Discussion Forum System attempts to replace the existing manual course
discussions, evaluation feedback process. The new system will interface with the different
systems, services and Course Discussion Forum Database System.

        <br /><br />

The Course Discussion Forum System will consist of a client component and server component.
The server component must interface with the Front end UI application and Course Discussion
Forum Database Systems.

browser using Internet. A user must be registered to use the application. A valid User ID and
password must be entered in order for access to the application to be granted.</h3>
